# Capstone Project
## Project Description 
Capstone Project for MetaU Summer 2022
## Ideation Process:
### Themes:
- Navigation
### Problem Statements:
- People tend to feel unsafe walking alone outside, especially at night. 
### Solutions Brainstorm:
- An website that allows friends and family to track you on your walking route.
- An website that allows you to avoid certain areas that may be more dangerous to walk on your walking route.
- An website that allows you to get help immediately if you feel in danger or potentially unsafe while on a walking route
### Feature Brainstorm:
- IDEA: A website that shows you what areas to avoid and plans out the safest route for you to walk.
    - CORE FEATURES
        - Home Page
        - Navigation Page (Route planning page)
        - Sign up Page
        - Log in Page
        - Profile Page
    - STRETCH FEATURES
        - Favorite Locations Page
        - Emergency Contacts Page
        - Select Friends & Family to track
### User Roles:
- "walker": a user who wants to find the safest route to walk
- (stretch feature) "tracker": a user (a parent, friend, or family member) that wants to ensure someone is getting to a destination safely and staying on their general walking path
### User Personas:
- The user is anybody who is walking somewhere and wants to plan their walking route in advance. The website is intended for people of any age, and has any kind of device in which they can access a website with. They might access the website any time they plan on walking somewhere and don't feel safe walking alone or want to ensure their safety.
### User Stories:
- As somebody who tends to walk alone, I want to see a list of the safest routes that get me from point A to point B while ensuring my safety. 
- As somebody who walks alone often, I want to be able to feel safe and have all my safety resources centralized into one website.
- As a parent, I want to track my child on their walking route to school, so that I can ensure they are safe.
- As a friend, I want to see the route my friend is walking, so that I can make sure that they are safe. 
- As someone who walks alone, I want to have a website that shows me possible safe live routes, so that I am kept up to date on what is happening near me or on my walking route.
